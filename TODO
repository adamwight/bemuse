better lookup failures

binder
  lined pages for entry
  people
  TOC for call(s), overview toc
  very brief statement
  brief circ for all printed views

browse

  doesn't handle call system switches right?

build
  mysql_config from Makefile
  strip
  versioning

edit
  ! can't save call or isbn changes
  list source catalog
  holding link is illogical?

entry
  save failures in queue
  r title alone entry reports null lccn instead
    entry lets empty authors go by in auto and manual mode
  ! empty search gives no feedback
      correct response is:
	  1. this is what you typed
	  2. want to save a placeholder?
      it works for 1572241071!
  ! " in title breaks something in entry and edit
  title/author forwards to lookup page for verification, then returns
    book can be added as already borrowed, home and lives at
    already lent_out checkbox
    home defaults to current location
    lent_to can be left 1) anonymous 2) define in next page 3) define now?
  results are stored, separate from action, so they can be re-displayed as the queue is improved (lookup too?)
  prevent double adds from history nav with unique id
  sublocation. popup and add button
  popup for lent_to
  lookup link directly after t/a entry
  entry results come after the form, so you can add books before page load.
  focus defaults to the type of entry used previously
  safe-ify html (at minimum, what we save in db)

general
  empty author falls back to responsible almost everywhere: get_any_author
  hide bad books, with a red count on many pages linking to touchup tools
  verbosity prefs
  reports of different perspectives for real tasks like inventory
  disallow duplicate librarian/city

instruments
  display comments after instrument listing

international
  add a big .ru and .uk library and their call systems
  accented characters
  decode utf8 strings from z39.50

lookup
  score and sort by completeness, agreement
    exact matches in their own league
  lower priority for search threads or whatever is locking the box
  background enhancing scanner
      an idle task could slowly gather other country's call no's, subjects,
      safely appending information
  versioning
    check that robot never contradicts a previous human decision
    pointer to last_manual_edit
  reject empty or duplicate Notes
  manual entry of Notes
  enhancement, grouping algorithm is a tree. parent nodes are composites.
      normalize out edition, so group results with a popup of publishers and years
  speed
      show the first result immediately, keep top
      display local db results immediately
      timeout
	  lookup should stop hounding the world once it gets 20 results or so...
	  or a very high score, exact match
      The title w/o author lookup in particular must be sucking resources
      multithreaded
	  1 per server
	  global queue in batch mode, each catalog works through it
  read amazon source and write get_image by isbn

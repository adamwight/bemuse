      INTRODUCTION

MARC 21 records in the MARC-8 environment are encoded according to the
specifications below. All characters are 8-bit per character or 24-bit
per character (Chinese, Japanese and Korean). Different sets of
characters are accessed via escape sequences.


        MARC-8 Markers

In the MARC 21 record, Leader character position 9 contains the value
blank (ASCII 20(hex)) if the record is encoded using MARC-8 sets. Field
066 is also used to indicate the MARC-8 sets in the record other than
the default sets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      IMPLEMENTATION

The MARC-8 coded character set is 8-bit. The individual characters are
commonly referred to by hexadecimal notation. The hex codes for
characters may be determined from the code matrix column number and row
number. For instance, the SPACE character, which is expressed in binary
notation as 00100000, is expressed in hexadecimal notation as 20, (also
written as 20(hex)).

There are control characters defined in ASCII that are not used in a
MARC 21 communications record (e.g., null, ASCII 00(hex)). There are
also spacing graphic characters in ASCII which closely resemble
nonspacing combining characters in ANSEL (i.e., spacing circumflex
(ASCII 3E(hex)), spacing underscore (ASCII 5F(hex)), spacing grave
(ASCII 60(hex)), and spacing tilde (ASCII 7E(hex))). In MARC 21 records,
the use of the spacing ASCII diacritical marks is limited to situations
where the intent is not to represent a letter-with-diacritic
combination, e.g., the encoding of file names, etc.

An 8-bit coded character set accommodates two sets of 32 control
functions (C0 and C1), two sets of 94 graphic characters (G0 and G1), a
SPACE character, a DELETE character, and two reserved character
positions (see /Figure/). The C0 and C1 control functions, and the SPACE
character can be accessed at anytime as they are not affected by the
designation and invocation of different graphic sets.

* Figure: 8-bit Code Matrix *

8-bit Code Matrix

Graphic character sets may be represented by either 8 bits per
character, or, where a larger number of characters needs to be
accommodated by the character set, by more than 8 bits codes per
character (usually in multiples of 8).

According to /Code Extension Techniques for Use with 7-bit and 8-bit
Character Sets/ (ANSI X3.41), the general technique for the use of code
sets requires first the * designation * of the sets, then the *
invocation * of a designated set as the * working * set. For 8-bit
codes, two sets of control functions and four graphic character sets may
be designated at any given time. The designated sets of control
functions are called the C0 and C1 sets. The designated sets of graphic
characters are called the G0, G1, G2, and G3 sets. Two Cn and two Gn
sets may be in an invoked, working set status at any given time. If, for
example, a specific character set is designated as the G0 set and
invoked as the working set, in order to change a working set either
another character set must be designated as the G0 set, or another
character set must be designated as set G1, G2 or G3 and that set
invoked as a working set. The following sections specify the designation
and invocation of code sets in MARC 21.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      CONTROL FUNCTION SETS

The C0 and C1 control function sets are fixed for MARC 21. They are thus
designated and invoked by default and need not be designated and invoked
in the record.

The C0 set is the set of 32 control functions defined in ASCII. They
occupy codes 00(hex) through 1F(hex) at all times. This set contains
basic control characters, of which only four characters may be used in
MARC 21 records. These four characters are the escape character
(1B(hex)), subfield delimiter (1F(hex)), field terminator (1E(hex)), and
record terminator (1D(hex)). The C1 set is another set of 32 possible
control characters which occupy codes 80(hex) through 9F(hex) at all
times. There are four control character currently defined for use in
MARC 21 records: non-sorting character(s) begin, 88(hex); non-sorting
character(s) end, 89(hex); joiner 8D(hex); and nonjoiner 8E(hex). The
latter two control characters are used to control the environment of
graphic characters whose proximity to other characters affects their
processing. Specifications for use of the non-sorting characters are
contained in the MARC 21 bibliographic format. As of July 1999 the rules
for use were not yet completely decided. When they are, they will be
published in the format and be available from the MARC web site (
www.loc.gov/marc/ <http://www.loc.gov/marc/>).

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      GRAPHIC CHARACTER SETS

ASCII graphics are the default G0 set and ANSEL graphics are the default
G1 set for MARC 21 records. ASCII graphics are invoked as the working
set for codes 21(hex) through 7E(hex). ANSEL, a graphic character set of
nonspacing and spacing marks and special signs, is designated as the
graphic G1 set, invoked as the working set for codes A1(hex) through
FE(hex). These are the default working sets for data transcribed in the
fields and subfields unless other default sets are specified in the
record field 066 (Character Sets Present). Additional graphic character
sets may also be accessed using special techniques. Upon exit from a
subfield, ASCII must be designated the G0 set.

There are two special characters positions in every "G" code block
(e.g., G0) assigned to graphic characters; one at the beginning (20(hex)
or A0(hex) in an 8-bit environment) and one at the end (7F(hex) or
FF(hex) in an 8-bit environment). The space character, which is
interpreted both as a /graphic character/ and as a /control character/,
occupies 20 (hex). In MARC 21 records it is used in indicators, coded
data elements, and variable fields. This /character/ is also referred to
as "blank" in MARC 21 documentation. The /delete/ character occupies the
second of the two special character positions. It is a /control
character/ that is not used in MARC 21 records.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      NONSPACING GRAPHIC CHARACTERS (DIACRITICS)

Nonspacing graphic characters are always used in conjunction with other
spacing graphic characters. More than one nonspacing graphic character
may be associated with one spacing graphic character. MARC 21 does not
use the ASCII spacing equivalents of the ANSEL nonspacing graphic
characters to encode diacritical marks associated with alphabetic
characters. The nonspacing graphic characters that are used in
conjunction with ASCII spacing graphic characters appear in the ANSEL
character set in columns E-F (8-bit, G1 set). In the Arabic character
set, nonspacing characters appear in columns 4-7, and F (8-bit set). In
the Greek set, nonspacing characters appear in column 2. In the Hebrew
character set, nonspacing characters appear in column 4 (8-bit, G0 set).
In a character string, these nonspacing characters precede the character
that they modify. When a graphic character requires multiple character
modifiers, they are entered in the order in which they appear, reading
left to right (or right to left with right-to-left scripts) and top to
bottom.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      ACCESSING ALTERNATE GRAPHIC CHARACTER SETS

There are currently two techniques established in MARC 21 to access an
alternate graphic character set. One way is a special technique for
accessing a small number of characters; the other involves using
standard escape sequences to access any well defined character set.
Below is an explanation of these two techniques.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


        Technique 1: Greek Symbols, Subscript, and Superscript Characters

Three Greek symbols (alpha, beta, and gamma), fourteen subscript
characters, and fourteen superscript characters have been placed in
three separate character sets that are accessed by a locking escape
sequence. The technique for accessing these characters is outside the
framework specified in ANSI X3.41 or ISO 2022. These three special sets
are designated as G0 sets in codes 21(hex) through 7E(hex) by means of a
two-character sequence consisting of the /Escape/ character and an ASCII
/graphic character/. The specific escape sequences for the three special
sets are:

      ESCg (ASCII 1B(hex) 67(hex)) for the Greek symbol set
      ESCb (ASCII 1B(hex) 62(hex)) for the Subscript set
      ESCp (ASCII 1B(hex) 70(hex)) for the Superscript set

When one of these character sets is designated using the escape
sequence, the escape is locking which means that all characters
following the escape sequence are interpreted as being part of the newly
designated character set until another escape sequence is encountered.
This follow-on escape sequence may redesignate ASCII or designate
another special character set as the G0 set. To redesignate ASCII, the
following two-character escape sequence is used:

      ESCs (ASCII 1B(hex) 73(hex)) for ASCII default character set

------------------------------------------------------------------------


        Technique 2: Other Alternate Graphic Character Sets

All other alternate graphic character sets should be designated and
invoked in accordance with ANSI X3.41, /Code Extension Techniques for
Use with 7-bit and 8-bit Character Sets /or its international
counterpart ISO 2022. At the present time, additional sets are accessed
through designation as either G0 (codes 21(hex) through 7E(hex)) or G1
(codes A1(hex) through FE(hex)). Alternate graphic character sets are
designated by means of a multiple character escape sequence consisting
of the ESCAPE character, an Intermediate character sequence, and a Final
character sequence in the form ESC I F, where:

    * ESC is the ESCAPE character (ASCII 1B(hex)).

    * I is the Intermediate character sequence, which may be one or more
      characters in length and indicates whether the set is designated
      as the G0 set or the G1 set and whether the set has one byte or
      multiple bytes per character. The following values may be used for
      the Intermediate character sequence:

      _To designate as the G0 set:_

            For a set with one byte per character
                  I = 28(hex) [ASCII graphic: ( ]
                  or I = 2C(hex) [ASCII graphic: , ].

            For a set with multiple bytes per character

                  I = 24(hex) [ASCII graphic: $ ]
                  or I = 24(hex) 2C(hex) [ASCII graphics: $ , ].

      _To designate as the G1 set:_

            For a set with one byte per character
                  I = 29(hex) [ASCII graphic: ) ]
                  or I = 2D(hex) [ASCII graphic: - ].
            For a set with multiple bytes per character
                  I = 24(hex) 29(hex) [ASCII graphics: $ ) ]
                  or I = 24(hex) 2D(hex) [ASCII graphics: $ - ].

    * F is the Final character in the escape sequence, which identifies
      the graphic character set being designated. The codes for Final
      characters are assigned by the registration authority of the
      International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for many
      sets. These sets are assigned codes in the range 40(hex) through
      7E(hex); other character sets intended for local use may be
      assigned a code outside this range. The Final characters for
      alternate graphic character sets approved for use in MARC 21 are
      the following:
            33(hex) [ASCII graphic: 3] = Basic Arabic
            34(hex) [ASCII graphic: 4] = Extended Arabic
            42(hex) [ASCII graphic: B] = Basic Latin (ASCII)
            21 45(hex) [ASCII graphic: !E] = Extended Latin (ANSEL)
            31(hex) [ASCII graphic: 1] = Chinese, Japanese, Korean (EACC)
            4E(hex) [ASCII graphic: N] = Basic Cyrillic
            51(hex) [ASCII graphic: Q] = Extended Cyrillic
            53(hex) [ASCII graphic: S] = Basic Greek
            32(hex) [ASCII graphic: 2] = Basic Hebrew

Whenever alternate graphic character sets accessed using Technique 2 are
used in a MARC 21 bibliographic record, field 066 (Character Sets
Present) must appear in the record. The alternate graphic character sets
are identified in subfield $c of field 066 to assist machine processing.
[See /MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data/.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------


        Use and Placement of Escape Sequences

Escape sequences to designate alternate graphic character sets may occur
wherever the alternate characters are needed, e.g., within a word, at
the beginning of a subfield, or in the middle of a subfield. However,
the escape sequence never replaces a space.

Escape sequences are locking. The alternate graphic character set
remains designated as the Gn set until another graphic character set is
designated. If the ASCII graphics have been displaced as the G0 set
within a subfield, ASCII graphics must be designated as the G0 set
before subfield delimiters and field terminators. Some alternate
character sets include separately defined marks of punctuation that
duplicate those defined in ASCII. They may be used when the alternate
graphics are used.

Example:
Alternate Graphics Example

      E = ESCAPE character
      ( = set is designated as the G0 set and has one byte per character
      N = Basic Cyrillic character set
      B = ASCII default character set 

When the text of a field which has an indicator for nonfiling characters
begins with an escape sequence, the bytes in the escape sequence are not
included in the count of nonfiling characters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      FIELD ORIENTATION

The contents of a field in a MARC 21 record are always recorded in their
logical order, from the first character to the last, regardless of field
orientation. When data in a subfield is written in a right-to-left
script (Hebrew or Arabic), the subfield pair is followed by the escape
sequence which invokes the character set for the script and then
immediately by the first character of the text (i.e., exactly the same
as for text in a left-to-right script). The first character of text in a
right-to-left script does not occur at the end of the field just before
the field terminator.

Example: /(Order of data in MARC record)/ Field Orientation Example

Example: /(Order of data as it might be displayed)/ Field Orientation
Example

      E = ESCAPE character
      ( = set is to be designated as the G0 set and has one byte per
      character
      2 = Hebrew character set
      B = ASCII default character set

There may be one exception to logical order for data in the MARC-8
environment, numbers in the Arabic and Hebrew character sets. Several
options for encoding digits in Arabic or Hebrew text exist in the MARC-8
environment. Digits occur in the Basic Latin (ASCII) set (numbers
written as 1, 2, etc.), the Hebrew set (numbers written as 1, 2, etc.),
and the Arabic set (numbers written in the traditional "Hindi" form).
Multi-digit numbers in Hebrew or Arabic script fields encoded using the
Basic Latin set are always input in logical order. Those encoded using
the digits in the Arabic or Hebrew sets may have been input in visual
order, depending on the implementation. Users may choose to use the
Basic Latin or the Hebrew and Arabic encodings.

Left-to-right /field orientation/ is the default for fields in MARC 21
records. No special designation of field orientation is required for
character sets with left-to-right orientation. When a field contains
data whose orientation is from right to left, orientation is indicated
with a field orientation code appended to subfield $6 (Linkage). [See
/MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data/, Appendix A, subfield $6.]

The decision to designate the field orientation as right-to-left depends
on the predominance of data in a script that is read right-to-left at
the field and/or the record level. A field may contain a mixture of
scripts. Right-to-left field orientation is usually designated in the
following instances:

      - when a field contains only or mostly data in a right-to-left script
      - when a field contains data in both a right-to-left and a
      left-to-right script, but the preponderance of data in other
      fields is right-to-left
      - in order to maintain consistency among fields constituting the
      "body" of a bibliographic entry (2XX, 3XX, and 4XX fields)

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      FILL CHARACTER

The key to retaining the MARC structure, while simultaneously reducing
required coding specificity, is the fill character. For MARC 21 records,
the use of this fill character is limited to variable control fields
such as field 008 (Fixed-Length Data Elements). It may not be used in
the leader or in tags, indicators, or subfield codes. Presence of a fill
character in a variable control field indicates that the creator of the
record has not attempted to supply a value. In contrast, use of a code
value for "unknown" in a variable control field indicates that the
creator of the record has attempted to supply a value, but was unable to
determine what the appropriate value should be. The fill character may
be used in undefined character positions and in character positions for
which the MARC 21 format defines one or more values. Use of the fill
character in variable control fields is usually regulated by the policy
of the inputting agency.

For communication purposes, the fill character is represented by the
code 7C(hex) in the expanded 8-bit ASCII character set. The fill
character is represented graphically as the vertical bar ( | ).

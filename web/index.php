It's not about the <a href="call.php">books</a> and
<a href="mill.html">instruments</a> you can borrow on which site,
it's about the <a href="people.php">people</a> who thoughtfully choose which
books to <a href="entry.php">make public</a>.

<p>
These online tools help book lovers share their favorite books.
You cannot robotically press a "borrow" button --
you have to talk to the librarians who interest you and make arrangements
yourself.  The catalogue lives a parallel life as a published pamphlet.

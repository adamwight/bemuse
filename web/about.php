    <h3>The halfway library</h3>

This library is one way for people to share books with each other.
We keep books on our own shelves, but we
have an easy way to share catalog information, as if each of our
shelves were part of a larger library.
</p>

<p>
You can simply list the books you recommend, offer to lend them,
or give them away.  The details are entirely up to you.  This
service helps you find other people and their books.
</p>

<p>
This system is focused on creating local intellectual ecosystems
(and imagine how many more books are around town than at the library.
the librarian's own hoard, for example), and allowing for radically
experimental and social cataloging.  You should ask about that.
</p>

<p>
As you browse your bookshelf, remember the dusty clarinet or guitar
and list them in our new library of
musical <a href="mill.html">instruments</a>.

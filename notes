audit changes from backups and convert to an atomic format
save changes in this format all the time.


===========================
AUTOCONF

./configure fails mysteriously if yaz dev is not installed:
./configure: line 3104: syntax error near unexpected token `threads,3.0.30'
./configure: line 3104: `YAZ_INIT(threads,3.0.30)'

config.status: error: cannot find input file: config.h.in

split out desktop as optional build

libcataloger.so would need ld.so.  just .a?

BUGS

set location is fukt

redo about: what is unique? confuse with future concepts?

package as distro
    optional php install better than scripts - platform
    tighten security through obscurity
    simplify and automate db privs.
        isolate mysql?
        user web sometimes= apache?
        grant all privileges on library.* to 'web'@'localhost' identified by 'gronk';
        grant all privileges on books.* to 'apache'@'localhost' identified by 'gronk';
        grant all privileges on books.* to 'web'@'localhost' identified by 'gronk';
    reviews retrieval code is pluggable
    doesn't scale -- but keep this scale also.
    make distclean vs maintainer-clean
    libtoolize cataloger

link into and across other library projects
    including instances of self

easy to switch call systems

stylize
    div menu; actions
    center and columnize except for print media

when user creates a location, keep a session var open so it don't
disappear even without a book.

lots of barf when php warnings are on

indicator icon and cross-query reviews in page and maybe postcard view

line views / postcard view / page view

entry.php selects by query_result even if {} BAD

classifications_* using $call_system is cheezy

cmd_link in edit.php for r/o <-> r/w book view

move get_session_value defaults (and valid re) into a table

recommend a local and partial install for project gutenberg
    ? don't understand. but do link to the text or net services?

manual title edit doesn't update title_sort

yaz-client catalog.library.cornell.edu:7090/VOYAGER

make bibliographic lists [?]

get the unused book/subject data the fuck out of O()

rename classifications.php
    get_any_location -> setup_location_please / insist / strict
    call.php -> shelf.php
    db:physical is not what i mean.  person-book.

big red letters that an installation is in debug mode

create table search_results (
n int unsigned auto_increment,
book_id int unsigned not null,

primary key 'n'
);

ideal flow:
    entry by isbn
	find matches
	display 0 or more results
	get confirmation
    entry by title

select z.*,count(*) from book left join z_server z on z.n=book.source_id group by source_id;
